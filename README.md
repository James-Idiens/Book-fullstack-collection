# Fullstack Collection App

## About

This is a full-stack web application as part of my portfolio. It's a demonstration of my proficiency in handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a web application. This project highlights my skills in integrating front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Tech used

- React: I utilized React to craft the user interface and manage the interactions on the front-end. It enables me to create reusable components and efficiently manage the application's state.
- TypeScript: I leveraged TypeScript's static type-checking and enhanced code quality to ensure a robust application.
- Express: I used Express to build the back-end API, allowing me to handle various HTTP requests and create RESTful routes.
- SQLite: For data storage, I employed SQLite, a lightweight and self-contained database engine.
- Knex: To interact with the database, I used Knex, a SQL query builder that simplifies database operations.

## Features
This application demonstrates the following key features:

- Create: Users can add new books and authors to the collection seamlessly.
- Read: The app displays a list of books and authors, offering a comprehensive view of the collection.
- Update: I implemented a smooth process to edit the details of existing books and authors.
- Delete: Users can effortlessly remove books and authors from the collection.

## Testing
For testing I used Vitest and implemented comprehensive test coverage
