# Fullstack Collection App

A small full-stack application demonstrating CRUD functionality with books and authors.

## About

This project is a small but complete full-stack application that showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It allows users to manage a collection of books and authors.

I made this project to learn more about TypeScript and to practice full-stack development. It gave me a chance to fully intergrate all the technologies I've learned so far.

## Tech used

- React
- TypeScript
- SQLite
- Knex

## Usage
Clone down, install dependencies <code>npm install</code> run seeds <code>npm run knex seed:run <code>npm run dev</code> to launch the application
